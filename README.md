# **CMU15213-Labs-**
### 4 labs uploaded
- **Malloc Lab**: Corresponds to the malloclab-handout directory. Implemented own versions of malloc() free() and realloc() and a segregated list to store all free pages, achieving high time and space efficiency. Main code in mm.c and mm.h
- **Proxy Lab**: Corresponds to proxylab-handout directory. Implemented a proxy between the browser and the world-wide-web that allows caching of requests by building our own cache, achieveing concurrency and utilising relevant knowledge in processes, signals etc. Main code in proxy.c cache.c cache.h
- **Shell Lab**: Corresponds to shlab-handout directory. Implemented a basic unix shell that reacts to ctrl-c ctrl-z keyboard interrupts, as well as executes basic commands fg(foreground process), bg(background process), using knowledge about processes, signals between processes and concurrency. Main code in tsh.c
- **Cache Lab**: Corresponds to cachelab-handout directory. Built a cache simulation that allows the user to customise the number of cache sets, and cache lines per set, with LRU eviction policy. Used this to improve the cache hit rate of a matrix transpose function. Main code in csim.c
